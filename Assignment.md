## Overall Objective


Create the architecture and design of a medical journals publication and subscription system. Implement the system's services and applications.

# Prerequisites


The following prerequisites should be respected.

Use one major technology stack for development out of either .NET or Java along with any compatible open technologies.

Use any database and development environment tools according to the technology stack chosen.

Do not use any proprietary technologies or tools that are not available for evaluation.

Functional Requirements


The system allows publishing and subscribing to medical journals in a secure way. The system implements the following specifications.

For publishers

A web portal to upload and manage a list of medical journals

To upload journals in PDF format

For public users

A web portal to find and subscribe to journals of their interest

A desktop client

To list and read the subscribed journals

That does not allow copying the journal’s content in any common way

Not from web requests/responses

Not from their file system

Not from the client user interface (copy to clipboard, screenshot, etc)

Assume any functional details required to achieve the above requirements based on logic and your experience, but follow the KISS principle.

Other Technical and Non-functional Requirements


The following list of technical specifications should be adhered to

Assume missing/unclear requirements to fill in the gaps in the specifications.

Choose a mix of server and client side technologies for an efficient design.

Secure the applications and services.

Use only software enforced protection that does not require any special hardware.

What we will evaluate


Efficacy of your submission: fundamentally how well your solution is able to achieve the assignment objective and solve the stated problem.

Code quality

Code modularity

Application organization across files and within each file - please ensure you follow the framework standards

Code documentation - balancing between self documenting code and comments

Unit and integration testing

Exception handling where available and expected in the frameworks you’re using

For any technology used, the correct usage of that technology based on consecrated best practices

Design

Clarity and completeness of the readme and design documents

Fitness of solution to problem

Efficiency of communication flows between frontend and backend, if applicable

Functional completeness

Scoring ratio matrix (out of 10), all of these are individually mandatory so don’t skip any:

Design quality = 2

Code quality = 3

Docs and demo quality = 2

Specifications compliance = 3

What to deliver

Demonstration Video
Record the video demonstration of your work using a screencast tool like screen-o-matic (or any other tool you prefer) commenting on the execution of all components. Save the video to your local machine and include it with the delivery package.

Database script
Create manual steps and SQL script files to create the database (if required), its schema, stored procedures, or any seed data you have used for testing. If using code first migrations to manage the database (if required), then also do not forget to mention the steps in the readme.

Readme Document
Create a txt file with the following information

Instructions to install and configure prerequisites or dependencies, if any

Instructions to create and initialize the database (if required)

Assumptions you have made - it is good to explain your thought process and the assumptions you have made

Requirements that you have not covered in your submission, if any

Instructions to configure and prepare the source code to build and run properly

Issues you have faced while completing the assignment, if any

Constructive feedback for improving the assignment

Design Document
Create a design document containing the following

High level requirement analysis

High level presentation of the data model

Architecture diagrams describing the composition and working of the system, explaining the component interaction and process, control and data flows.

Explain the breakdown of the system into components with technical implementation details of each component along with the design patterns involved and with reasons that justify your choices.

Use both visual elements (diagrams) and text descriptions to maximize the amount of information conveyed while keeping the document as compact as possible

Source Code
You should deliver all the implemented source code including any dependencies. For the dependencies that could not be included due to size, the readme file should have proper instructions on how to download and install them.

What to submit

Please read this section carefully.

Failing to follow these directions will disqualify you from consideration.


Create and submit an archive named <your_name>_SEM_Journals_<Tech>.zip containing the following:
(For example JohnDoug_SEM_Journals_NET.zip, or MaryDoug_SEM_Journals_Java.zip)

<your_name>_SEM_Journals_<Tech>.zip

<your_name>_SEM_Journals_<Tech>.zip \Readme.txt

<your_name>_SEM_Journals_<Tech>.zip \Design.doc (or pdf etc)

<your_name>_SEM_Journals_<Tech>.zip \Demo\    < this folder contains the screencast video recording

<your_name>_SEM_Journals_<Tech>.zip \Source\    < this folder contains the complete source code

Check that the size of the archive is less than 30MB. If not, reduce the size of the demo video by removing similar frames and remove the 3rd party binary dependencies
